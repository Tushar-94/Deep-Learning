# Welcome to Computer Vision! 👁️‍🗨️

Have you ever wanted to **teach a computer to see**? In this notebook, that's exactly what we'll do!  

This project introduces the **fundamental ideas of computer vision** and guides you through building neural networks capable of understanding images—just like the human visual system.

## What We'll Learn

Computer vision is powered by **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**—sometimes called **convnets**.  
Convolution is the mathematical operation that gives CNN layers their unique structure, allowing them to **extract visual features effectively**.  

By the end of this notebook, we'll be able to:

- Build modern **deep-learning image classifiers** using Keras  
- Design your **custom convolutional networks** with reusable blocks  
- Understand **visual feature extraction** in neural networks  
- Apply **transfer learning** to leverage pre-trained models  
- Use **data augmentation** to expand your datasets and improve performance

## Problem Focus: Image Classification

Image classification is the task of telling a computer what a picture contains. Examples include:

- Identifying species of plants or animals from photos  
- Detecting objects in self-driving car applications  
- Recognizing handwritten digits or letters  

In this notebook, we focus on image classification, but the skills we’ll learn are **applicable to all computer vision problems**, including:

- **Image segmentation**  
- **Object detection**  
- **Generative models (GANs)**
