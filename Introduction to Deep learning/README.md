# 🧠 Introduction to Deep Learning

Welcome to the **Introduction to Deep Learning** notebook! This repository provides a beginner-friendly, hands-on introduction to deep learning concepts using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**. The notebook walks through the core ideas behind neural networks and demonstrates how they are applied to real-world machine learning problems.

## 📌 What is Deep Learning?

Some of the most impressive advances in artificial intelligence in recent years have come from **deep learning**. Tasks such as:

- 🌍 Natural language translation

- 🖼️ Image recognition

- 🎮 Game playing

have seen models reach or even surpass **human-level performance**.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning characterized by deep stacks of computations. This computational depth allows models to learn complex, hierarchical patterns from large and challenging datasets.

At the heart of deep learning are **neural networks**.

### 🔗 Neural Networks in a Nutshell

- Neural networks are composed of neurons

- Each neuron performs a simple computation

- The true power comes from the complex connections between neurons

Together, these networks can model highly non-linear and abstract relationships in data.
